Workspace: Looking at the code, there are a few issues and concepts to discuss, particularly around the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

The main issue in this code is that you're trying to use variables 

a

 and 

b

 before they are declared, which leads to undefined behavior. Let's explain the TDZ:

The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the period between entering a scope where a variable is defined and its actual declaration. This concept is specifically related to `let` and `const` declarations, not `var`.

Here's a corrected version of your code with explanations:

```javascript
// This version shows the TDZ concept
let a = 5;  // Variables should be declared and initialized first
let b = 3;  // Using let instead of var to demonstrate TDZ

function addition(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

addition(a, b);
```

Key points:
1. `var` declarations are hoisted with an initial value of `undefined`
2. `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted but remain uninitialized (in TDZ)
3. Accessing variables in TDZ throws a `ReferenceError`

Example of TDZ:
```javascript
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 1;

console.log(y); // undefined
var y = 1;
```

To fix your code:
1. Declare variables before using them
2. Initialize variables with values
3. Consider using `let` instead of `var` for better scoping rules
4. Add error handling if needed
