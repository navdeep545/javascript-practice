Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Current Issue**
- This isn't actually a shallow copy
- 

obj2 = obj1

 creates a reference to the same object
- Any changes to nested objects affect both 

obj1

 and 

obj2



2. **Solution Plan**
- Demonstrate proper shallow copy using `Object.assign()` or spread operator
- Show the difference between shallow and deep copying
- Explain why nested objects still share references

Here's the corrected code:

```javascript


// Shallow copy example
const obj1 = {
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: {
        d: 3,
        e: 4
    }
};

// Proper shallow copy using spread operator
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };
// OR using Object.assign
// const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1);

obj2.c.e = 20; // Will still affect obj1 because nested objects share reference
obj2.b = 10;   // Won't affect obj1 because it's a top-level property

console.log('obj1.b:', obj1.b);    // Output: 2 (unchanged)
console.log('obj2.b:', obj2.b);    // Output: 10
console.log('obj1.c.e:', obj1.c.e); // Output: 20 (changed because of shared reference)
```

For a true deep copy, you would need to use:
```javascript
const obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));
```
or a deep cloning library like Lodash's `_.cloneDeep()`.
