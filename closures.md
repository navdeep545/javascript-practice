**Notes on "Closures in JavaScript ðŸ”¥ | Namaste JavaScript Episode 10" by Akshay Saini**

### **1. Definition of Closure**
- A **closure** is a function bundled with its lexical environment (surrounding state).
- It allows a function to retain access to its parent scope's variables even after the parent function has finished executing.
- **Key Idea**: Functions in JavaScript "remember" the environment where they were created.

---

### **2. How Closures Work**
- **Lexical Scoping**: JavaScript uses lexical scoping (static scoping), meaning variable scope is determined by their position in the source code.
- **Scope Chain**: When a function is defined, it captures the entire scope chain (its own scope + outer scopes).
- **Garbage Collection**: Variables referenced by closures are not garbage-collected, even if the outer function completes execution.

---

### **3. Example Code Snippets**
#### **Basic Closure**
```javascript
function outer() {
  let x = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(x); // Accesses x from outer's scope
  }
  return inner;
}
const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc(); // Output: 10 (closure preserves x)
```

#### **Counter Using Closure**
```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

---

### **4. Key Use Cases**
- **Data Encapsulation**: Create private variables/methods (e.g., module pattern).
- **Functional Programming**: Enable currying, memoization, and higher-order functions.
- **Event Handlers**: Retain state (e.g., track button clicks without global variables).
- **Asynchronous Code**: Preserve values in loops with `setTimeout` or event listeners.

---

### **5. Common Pitfalls & Solutions**
#### **Loop with `var` (Problem)**
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); // Output: 3, 3, 3
}
```
- **Why?** `var` is function-scoped; all closures share the same `i`.

#### **Solution with `let` (Block Scoping)**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); // Output: 0, 1, 2
}
```
- **Why?** `let` creates a new `i` for each iteration.

---

### **6. Advanced Concepts**
- **Module Pattern**: Use closures to expose public APIs while hiding private data.
  ```javascript
  const module = (() => {
    let privateVar = 0;
    return {
      increment: () => privateVar++,
      getValue: () => privateVar,
    };
  })();
  ```
- **Memory Leaks**: Closures can retain large objects unnecessarily. Always nullify references when done.

---

### **7. Interview Questions**
1. **Write a closure-based function to create a multiplier.**
   ```javascript
   function createMultiplier(n) {
     return (x) => x * n;
   }
   const double = createMultiplier(2);
   console.log(double(5)); // 10
   ```

2. **What is the output?**
   ```javascript
   let a = 100;
   function outer() {
     let a = 10;
     function inner() {
       console.log(a);
     }
     return inner;
   }
   outer()(); // Output: 10 (closure over outer's a)
   ```

3. **Fix the loop closure issue without `let`.**
   ```javascript
   for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
     ((i) => setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000))(i); // IIFE solution
   }
   ```

---

### **8. Key Takeaways**
- Closures = Function + Lexical Environment.
- Enable powerful patterns like encapsulation and currying.
- Watch out for unintended closures in loops (use `let` or IIFEs).
- Memory management is crucial to avoid leaks.
